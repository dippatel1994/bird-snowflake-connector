# Spider to Snowflake - Improvements and Fixes

This document summarizes the improvements and fixes implemented to make the Spider SQLite to Snowflake upload process more robust.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Column Names with Spaces

- **Problem**: Tables containing column names with spaces failed to create properly in Snowflake.
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified the `generate_create_table_sql` function to always quote column names in generated SQL.
  - Updated the `upload_to_snowflake.py` script to detect and fix unquoted column names during retry attempts.

### 2. SQL Reserved Keywords

- **Problem**: Tables with names that are SQL reserved words (like "order") caused syntax errors.
- **Solution**:
  - Added a comprehensive list of SQL reserved keywords.
  - Implemented special handling for reserved keyword tables in both export and upload scripts.
  - Created a dedicated handler for the "order" table in the financial database with a manually defined schema.

### 3. Duplicate Upload Prevention

- **Problem**: Re-running the upload script would attempt to upload data to tables that already contained data.
- **Solution**:
  - Added a `table_exists_and_has_data` function that checks if a table exists and has rows before uploading.
  - Modified the upload process to skip tables that already have data, preventing duplicate uploads.

### 4. Improved Error Handling

- **Problem**: Creation failures for some tables didn't have proper error handling and retry logic.
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented a `create_table_with_retry` function with intelligent retry logic.
  - Added specific handling for common errors like syntax issues and reserved keywords.

### 5. Better Table Naming Convention

- **Problem**: The original table naming convention could cause confusion.
- **Solution**:
  - Updated the naming convention to include "_table_" between database name and table name for clarity (e.g., "database_table_tablename").
  - Updated all scripts to consistently use this naming pattern.

### 6. Comprehensive Logging

- **Problem**: Lack of detailed logs made troubleshooting difficult.
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced logging throughout both export and upload scripts.
  - Added detailed error messages and progress reporting.
  - Provided clear statistics about successful/failed operations.

### 7. Simplified User Experience

- **Problem**: The execution flow wasn't intuitive for users.
- **Solution**:
  - Created a `run_upload.sh` script to simplify the upload process.
  - Updated the README with clear instructions and examples.
  - Added detailed descriptions of edge cases and how they're handled.

## Directory Structure

- `output_csv/`: Contains exported CSV files organized by database.
- `output_sql/`: Contains CREATE TABLE SQL statements.
- `logs/`: Contains detailed logs from export and upload operations.

## Running the Solution

```bash
# Step 1: Export SQLite to CSV
./export_to_csv.py

# Step 2: Upload to Snowflake
./run_upload.sh
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Batch Processing**: Implement batch processing for large datasets to improve performance.
2. **Schema Evolution**: Add support for updating existing tables if schema changes.
3. **Parallel Processing**: Implement parallel uploads for faster performance with large datasets.
4. **Enhanced Type Mapping**: Improve type mapping between SQLite and Snowflake for more complex data types.
5. **Error Recovery**: Add the ability to resume uploads after failure without starting from scratch.
